This is a basic Chrome extension that I made a couple years ago.

The extension queried a server for notifications, and presented a popup notification in the browser window.

It also displayed an icon in the Chrome chrome and displayed a badge indicating the number of notifications that needed to be addressed.

The extension could also open a browser tab to view a website to address the notifcations.
